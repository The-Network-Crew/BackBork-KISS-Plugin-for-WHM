## ⚠️ Why Cron Is Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **BackBork requires cron to function.** Without it, scheduled backups won't run and the queue won't process.

BackBork uses cron for:

| Function | Why It Needs Cron |
|----------|-------------------|
| 📅 **Scheduled Backups** | Triggers hourly/daily/weekly/monthly jobs |
| 📋 **Queue Processing** | Processes pending backup/restore jobs |
| 🧹 **Cleanup** | Removes old completed jobs and logs |
| 🔍 **Self-Monitoring** | Checks its own health status |

### What Happens Without Cron?

- ❌ Scheduled backups **never run**
- ❌ Queued jobs **stay pending forever**
- ❌ Old logs and job files **accumulate**
- ❌ No automatic health monitoring

---

## 🔧 Automatic Installation

The `install.sh` script **automatically installs** the cron configuration:

```bash
# This happens during installation
cat > /etc/cron.d/backbork << 'EOF'
# BackBork KISS - Queue and Schedule Processor
*/5 * * * * root /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/php /usr/local/cpanel/whostmgr/docroot/cgi/backbork/cron/handler.php >> /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/cron.log 2>&1

# Daily summary notification (runs at midnight)
0 0 * * * root /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/php /usr/local/cpanel/whostmgr/docroot/cgi/backbork/cron/handler.php summary >> /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/cron.log 2>&1

# Daily cleanup of old completed jobs and logs (runs at 3 AM)
0 3 * * * root /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/php /usr/local/cpanel/whostmgr/docroot/cgi/backbork/cron/handler.php cleanup >> /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/cron.log 2>&1
EOF
```

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to manually configure cron — the installer handles everything.

## 📋 Cron Jobs Explained

### 1️⃣ Queue Processor (Every 5 minutes)

```cron
*/5 * * * * root php .../cron/handler.php
```

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Schedule** | Every 5 minutes |

> **Note:** Manual processing using the "Process Queue Now" button is only available to root users; resellers cannot trigger it from the UI.
| **User** | root |
| **Purpose** | Process backup queue and scheduled jobs |

**What It Does:**

1. 📅 Checks for scheduled backups due to run
2. 📋 Adds due schedules to the queue
3. 🏃 Processes pending queue items
4. 📊 Updates job status
5. 📧 Sends notifications on completion
6. 🗑️ **Prunes old backups** based on schedule retention settings
7. 🔍 Performs self-health check

### 2️⃣ Retention Pruning (Hourly)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New in v1.2.8:** BackBork now automatically prunes old backups based on schedule retention settings.

Retention pruning runs **every hour** as part of the main cron job to ensure backup counts stay within limits, even with frequent schedules.

**How It Works:**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Trigger** | Runs hourly with main cron |
| **Scope** | Per-schedule, per-account |
| **Retention = 0** | Unlimited (no pruning) |
| **Default** | 30 backups |
| **Method** | Count-based (keeps N newest backups) |

**Pruning Logic:**

1. 📋 Iterates through all configured schedules
2. 🔍 Reads each schedule's `retention` setting (backup count)
3. 📂 Lists backups at the destination for each account
4. 🗓️ Sorts backups by age (newest first)
5. 📊 Compares count: if backups ≤ retention, **nothing is deleted**
6. 🗑️ If backups > retention, deletes the oldest excess backups

> [!NOTE]
> **Inherently Safe:** Count-based retention means pruning only occurs when you have MORE backups than the retention limit. If backups have been failing, no new backups exist to push older ones out — so nothing gets deleted.

**Example:**
- Schedule has `retention: 7` (keep 7 backups)
- Account has 10 backups → deletes the 3 oldest
- Account has 5 backups → nothing deleted (5 ≤ 7)
- Account has 1 backup (from failed runs) → nothing deleted (1 ≤ 7)

### 3️⃣ Daily Summary (Midnight)

```cron
0 0 * * * root php .../cron/handler.php summary
```

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Schedule** | Daily at midnight (00:00) |
| **User** | root (sends to all opted-in users) |
| **Purpose** | Send daily activity digest via Email/Slack |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New in v1.2.8:** Daily summary notifications provide a digest of the past 24 hours.

**Opt-In Setting:**

Each user can enable daily summaries in **Settings → Notification Settings**:
- ☑️ **Daily Summary (midnight)** checkbox

The cron job scans all user configs and sends summaries only to users who have:
1. Enabled the "Daily Summary" checkbox
2. Configured Email and/or Slack webhook

**What It Reports:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📊 **Backups** | Successful and failed backup counts |
| 🔄 **Restores** | Successful and failed restore counts |
| 📅 **Schedules** | Number of scheduled jobs that ran |
| 🗑️ **Pruned** | Backups deleted by retention policy |
| 📋 **Queue** | Current pending/completed/failed jobs |
| ❌ **Errors** | Recent error messages (up to 5) |

**Notification Channels:**
- **Email:** Plain text digest to configured address
- **Slack:** Rich Block Kit formatted message with sections

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ **All Good** — Activity with no failures
- ⚠️ **Issues Detected** — One or more failures occurred
- ℹ️ **No Activity** — Nothing happened in 24 hours

### 4️⃣ Daily Cleanup

```cron
0 3 * * * root php .../cron/handler.php cleanup
```

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Schedule** | Daily at 3:00 AM |
| **User** | root |
| **Purpose** | Housekeeping and maintenance |

**What It Does:**

1. 🗑️ Removes completed job files older than 30 days
2. 📝 Rotates log files
3. 🧹 Cleans up orphaned temp files

---

## ✅ Status Monitoring

### In-App Status Check

BackBork **automatically checks cron status** when you open the Settings tab:

```
Settings → Cron Status
```

The status display shows:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ **Installed** | Cron file exists and is configured |
| ⏱️ **Last Run** | When cron last executed |
| 📅 **Next Run** | When cron will next execute |
| ❌ **Not Installed** | Cron file missing — needs attention |
| ⚠️ **Stale** | Cron hasn't run recently — may be stuck |

### API Endpoint

```bash
curl -k -H "Authorization: whm root:TOKEN" \
  "https://server:2087/cgi/backbork/api/router.php?action=check_cron"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cron": {
    "installed": true,
    "file": "/etc/cron.d/backbork",
    "last_run": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "next_run": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
    "status": "healthy"
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Failure Notifications

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New in v1.1.1:** BackBork now sends email/Slack alerts if cron status checks fail.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuring Alerts

Cron failure alerts use your existing notification settings:

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Configure **Email Address** and/or **Slack Webhook**
3. Alerts are sent automatically when issues are detected

> [!TIP]
> Enable both email and Slack for redundant alerting — if one fails, the other still notifies you.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ❌ Cron Not Installed

**Symptom:** Settings shows "Cron: Not Installed"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-run installer
cd /path/to/BackBork-KISS-Plugin-for-WHM
./install.sh

# Or manually create:
cat > /etc/cron.d/backbork << 'EOF'
*/5 * * * * root /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/php /usr/local/cpanel/whostmgr/docroot/cgi/backbork/cron/handler.php >> /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/cron.log 2>&1
0 3 * * * root /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/php /usr/local/cpanel/whostmgr/docroot/cgi/backbork/cron/handler.php cleanup >> /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/cron.log 2>&1
EOF
chmod 644 /etc/cron.d/backbork
```

### ⏱️ Cron Not Running

**Symptom:** Last run time is hours/days ago

**Checks:**
```bash
# Is crond running?
systemctl status crond

# Restart if needed
systemctl restart crond

# Check for syntax errors
crontab -l
cat /etc/cron.d/backbork
```

### 🔒 Permission Denied

**Symptom:** Cron log shows permission errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod 755 /usr/local/cpanel/whostmgr/docroot/cgi/backbork/cron/handler.php
chmod 700 /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/
chmod 700 /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/
```

### 📝 No Log Output

**Symptom:** cron.log is empty or not updating

**Checks:**
```bash
# Check log directory exists
ls -la /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/

# Check disk space
df -h

# Test write permissions
touch /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/test.txt
rm /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/logs/test.txt
```

### 🔄 Cron Running But Jobs Not Processing

**Symptom:** Cron runs but queue items stay pending

**Checks:**
```bash
# Check for lock file (indicates already running)
ls -la /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/queue.lock

# Remove stale lock (if process died)
rm -f /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/queue.lock

# Check queue files
ls -la /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/backbork/queue/
```
